Hello Teacher Phyu Hnin Myint,
I don’t know if you remember me since it has been more than a year. This is Ei Shune Le Tha from EWSD class back in 2022 January to May class of University Of Greenwich, KMD. I would like to humbly request a recommendation letter from you for my continuation to Master degree in Computing. I believe I can ask you for help since you’re one of my favorite lecturers through out my college years in KMD and you have been kind to me during the group projects as well as while answering to my enquiries in personal chats back then. And I am contacting you via this email since I was kicked out from Microsoft teams after graduation and this is the only way to reach out to you. If you have any spare time, please kindly help me on this :3.
